# Darzi: AI Resume Suite

An intelligent AI-powered resume building and optimization platform that helps job seekers create tailored resumes using advanced language models and ATS optimization techniques.

## Challenge Background
Navigating the modern job market is increasingly challenging, especially for candidates with limited access to professional resume writing services or insights into job-specific requirements. A mismatch between resumes and job descriptions often leads to rejections despite a candidate's qualifications.

With the emergence of AI, it is now possible to create intelligent systems that help job seekers present their best selves. By using LLMs, we can bridge the gap between candidate profiles and recruiter expectations.

This project aims to leverage LLMs to empower job seekers with personalized resume tailoring, ultimately improving job matching and boosting hiring success rates.

## Goal of the Project
Job seekers frequently face difficulties aligning their resumes with the expectations of specific job postings. Many fail to highlight the most relevant skills or experiences because they lack insights into what recruiters are looking for in each role.

This leads to high application drop-off rates and missed opportunities, especially for early-career professionals or candidates applying across domains. Furthermore, multilingual users often lack access to resume customization tools in their native languages, creating a barrier to equitable job access.

There is a clear need for an AI-powered, intuitive, and multilingual resume optimization tool that guides applicants through tailoring their resumes based on the exact requirements of a job post.
